        <h1>Javascript Analogy!</h1>
        <p>HTML is what I consider to be the structure of when you’re building a game. CSS is the designs, models, etc, basically CSS is the thing that makes all the world environments in the game so beautiful. <br>
           And Javascript is the mechanics, Javascript is what makes the game work, without Javascript, the game wouldn’t be a game, and just some glitchy mess instead.

          <h1>Control Flow & Loops!</h1>
          <p>Control flow is what is used to make code run in the order you want. It’s like telling someone to buckle your seatbelt before you drive your car. <br>
             As for loops, it’s like a routine, you keep doing that thing over and over again, you can add and remove certain things from your routine but you keep <br> looping through your routine until you don’t see any point in doing so anymore.

        <div class="DOMText">
          <h1>DOMS!</h1>
          <p>Web documents have a programming interface called the Document Object Model (DOM). So that software can alter the document's structure, appearance, and content, it serves as a representation of the page. <br> 
            Programming languages can communicate with a page by interacting with the nodes and objects that the DOM uses to represent the document.

        <div class="ArrayText">
          <h1>Arrays & Objects!</h1>
          <p>An array is a group of identically data-typed elements kept in consecutive memory regions. It’s kind of like a recipe or shopping list. <br> 
            An object is almost like the heart of your code, it’s data that contains practically any and all variables. Without an object, your variables will be lost.

        <div class="FunctionText">
          <h1>Functions!</h1>
          <p>A procedure must accept some input and return an output with some evident relationship between the input and the output in order to qualify as a function. <br>
            A function is a group of statements that performs a task or calculates a value.
